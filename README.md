# NueDifficulty
A Minecraft spigot plugin where I've created a custom difficulty setting through manipulation of player damage, mob events, and player death.

Honestly nothing crazy, just getting into plugin development to help my Dad and brother who are both first time minecraft players experience the game in a non-frustrating
way.

For other people learning how plugins work, my code may be useful or it might be absolutely worthless.
